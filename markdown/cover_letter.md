Oracle Corporation

Subject: Application for Director of Applied Science – Healthcare AI

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am excited to apply for the Director of Applied Science – Healthcare AI position at Oracle. With over a decade of leadership in AI, machine learning, and data-driven innovation—particularly in healthcare and complex system domains—I am deeply inspired by Oracle’s vision for Oracle Health & AI (OHAI): to modernize and automate healthcare through state-of-the-art science, engineering, and collaboration.

As Principal Artificial Intelligence Engineer at The MITRE Corporation, I have led end-to-end AI initiatives that bridge research and operations across agencies such as the Defense Health Agency (DHA) and DoD Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC). As the Chief Engineer, I have developed predictive analytics systems for medical readiness. I am also experienced in time-series anomaly detection under large uncertainties, and retrieval-augmented LLM systems for knowledge-based decision support. These experiences have honed my ability to integrate advanced AI architectures—transformers, graph neural networks, and multi-modal learning frameworks—into mission-critical environments where reliability, transparency, and measurable impact are paramount.

What draws me to Oracle Health & AI is its entrepreneurial mission to build a world-class applied science and engineering center within a global enterprise. I am particularly excited by the opportunity to shape the Healthcare AI roadmap, guiding research toward products that improve clinical workflows, empower practitioners, and unlock value from healthcare data. My approach emphasizes system-level design thinking, ensuring AI solutions are ethically grounded, operationally sound, and strategically aligned with business goals.

Equally important, I am passionate about building and mentoring high-performing teams. Throughout my tenure, I have cultivated cross-disciplinary collaboration between data scientists, Systems's Engineers, and domain experts—fostering an environment that values curiosity, technical rigor, and purpose-driven innovation. At Oracle, I look forward to continuing that tradition: identifying and nurturing emerging talent, promoting diversity of thought, and driving excellence consistent with OHAI’s values.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute my experience in applied AI research, system integration, and technical leadership to advance Oracle’s healthcare transformation initiatives. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background and vision align with the goals of the Oracle Health & AI organization.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,

Huang Tang
Principal Artificial Intelligence Engineer
