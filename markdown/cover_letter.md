Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the **Lead GenAI Agent Developer** role at **Fannie Mae**. With over twelve years of experience building and leading **secure, scalable AI and GenAI platforms** in highly regulated environments, I am excited by the opportunity to help advance Fannie Mae’s mission of expanding access to affordable housing through responsible, purpose-driven innovation.

In my role as a **Principal Artificial Intelligence Engineer at The MITRE Corporation**, I serve as a technical lead for enterprise-scale **LLM and Agentic AI platforms**, operating as governed gateways that enable multiple application teams to safely consume GenAI capabilities. My work closely aligns with Fannie Mae’s GenAI Gateway vision—spanning **LLM orchestration, agent lifecycle management, observability, cost optimization, and secure integration with enterprise data systems**.

I have architected and delivered **cloud-native AI platforms on AWS**, integrating foundational models, scalable APIs, and internal data sources while emphasizing **reliability, performance, and security**. A key focus of my work has been enhancing **end-to-end observability**, including telemetry for usage, latency, and cost, which has enabled proactive issue resolution and meaningful reductions in GenAI operational spend. These efforts mirror Fannie Mae’s emphasis on building resilient, high-quality AI services that provide consistent value to internal and external customers.

Beyond hands-on engineering, I bring a strong record of **technical leadership and mentorship**, guiding hybrid teams of full-time staff and contractors while collaborating closely with product, business, and mission stakeholders. I am particularly passionate about **responsible AI**, having designed platforms with auditability, traceability, and human-in-the-loop controls to ensure trust, compliance, and ethical use of GenAI in complex decision-making environments.

Fannie Mae’s commitment to leveraging technology in service of a broader social mission strongly resonates with me. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience in **GenAI platforms, AWS-based architecture, and enterprise AI enablement** to help Fannie Mae scale its AI capabilities responsibly and effectively.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and passion for GenAI platform engineering can support Fannie Mae’s goals.

Sincerely,

Huang Tang
